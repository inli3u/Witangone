NOT SUPPORTED

Just a loose list of things I know are not supported yet.


General
- Renaming of referenced taf/tml/html files to php equiv.
- Comments (outputting, they are parsed already.)
- Picking a column from an array I think is not supported. Example: <@assign request$emails @@request$rows[*, 1]>


SQL
- Aggregate functions
- OR conditions
- Nested conditions
- Running success/failure code


OPERATORS

;		Sub-statement separator, returns the value of the last statement.

:=		Assignment operator, assigns the value of the expression to the calculation variable, and returns that value.

? :		Ternary comparison. Evaluates to expr1 if condition is true, or to expr2 otherwise

â€“		Unary minus. Returns the negation of the expression.

NOT 	Logical NOT. Returns 0 if the value of the expression is not 0, or 1 otherwise.
		! is supported, NOT is not

foreach {}


NUMBERS
- Use of thousands separator in numbers.


NICE TO HAVE
- Add automatic PHP -l syntax check for each outputted file.
- if a string is just numbers, output as number instead.
- if an array accessor is index by number output the result of that number - 1 instead of outputting the - 1.
- for tml/html files, instead of echoing everything, use the PHP open/close tags.
